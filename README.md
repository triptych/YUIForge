#YUI Forge is an experiment in creating YUI components via simple menus, wizards, and GUI elements. 

It is also an experiment with creating a full-featured application using YUI itself.
  * create simple components
  * setup apps
  * fast boilerplate code


This app will make use of many of the existing YUI components, as well as additional new ones.
